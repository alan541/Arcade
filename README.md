# Arcade

A repository for a few old arcade games I have written (albeit with a small head start - e.g. blank screen and moveable bat for the breakout games)

There are two versions of the old game 'Breakout'. The first, breakout.gamesprites is a version of the original game but with two balls in play. It is written with sprite classes and collision functions. The second is a version of 'Super-Breakout' where the wall moves towards you and new walls appear behind.  The ball also speeds up at certain score milestones. This is written with raw code for all the collisions and movement/appearance of new walls. Use left and right arrows to move bat.

There is also a version of 'Snake' where you must eat the food pills to grow, but avoid hitting any of the walls or any part of yourself. The snake speeds up at certain score milestones. Use arrow keys to move.

Then, there is my version of 'Space Invaders', with many features similiar to the original game, such as aliens speeding up as the game goes on, temporary defence walls to shield behind and ufo's with bonus points appearing at the bottom of the screen. Use left and right to move and space bar to fire. It is written using object orientated programming.

Next, there is my version of "Phoenix", with many similar features to the original game, such as three different screen type plays, and difficulty increasing as you move onto new rounds. Use left and right to move and space bar to fire. Object is to avoid being hit and to kill all objects. In the final screen type it is to kill the queen alien which is protected by a wall and defenders, which you can also destroy. It is also written using object orientated programming.

Finally, there is my version of 'Scramble', using rolling screens from right to left and three distinct phases.  This game has an end point, but extra points are given for any lives in hand. The object of this game is mainly manoeuvering around objects and avoiding collisions, and also shooting in phase one.
