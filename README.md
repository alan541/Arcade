# Arcade

A repository for one or two old arcade games I have written (albeit with a small head start - e.g. blank screen and moveable bat for the breakout game)

The first is a version of 'Super-Breakout' where the wall moves towards you and new walls appear behind.  The ball also speeds up at certain score milestones.

The second is a version of 'Snake' where you must eat the food pills to grow, but avoid hitting any of the walls or any part of yourself. The snake speeds up at certain score milestones.
